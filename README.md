INTRODUCTION
The purpose of customer relationship management is to increase customer’s value that includes two primary activities: acquisition and retention. A failure of many companies faced is retaining the existing customers those people are tremendously valuable for business’s revenue. For this reason, Alpha Telecommunication emphasizes the necessary of churn predictive model by the way allowing business to determine who likely to churn and take action soon to retain them.

The existing customer base of Alpha Telecommunication includes 2 groups: churned customers and not-churned customers. The not-churned customers are active customers who are using services of Alpha Telecommunication. They could be clients who the business has acquired recently or either who are long-term customers. In fact, any ones in not-churned group are likely to churn in the future and that requires the business to take action on time to retain customers. A better view of who churned used to compare to the existing customers provides the business a higher opportunities to improve the customer relationship and turn them in loyal customers.
This part using descriptive techniques to answer 2 questions:
-	Which customers who left the business, who are active and especially who are loyal look like? 
-	Are there any difference of churned customers at different tenure values?
Datasets: churn dataset, not-churn dataset and loyal dataset (top 20% highest tenure of not-churn dataset)
